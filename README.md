# Course Registration

1. Add 3 project feature

- This project has 9 courses with it's details
- One can add only one course by clicking select button
- If the credit will be more then 20 hours you can not select more courses

2. Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project

I managed component state with useState, initializing state variables with useState(). For handling side effects and component lifecycle events, utilize useEffect, specifying dependencies to control when it executes.
